# Practical Work 1: Basic commands
Before one says anything, the output are from my Raspberry on Void as root.
It is supposed to be for showing off the uptime, but we had a power outage
last Saturday (otherwise it'd be around six months or so )-:).

Regarding the under-voltage issue, I am too lazy to find out the solution,
I am not even sure if it is a really issue since the machine runs just fine.
